# Titanic Survival Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors

A machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm as the primary classifier.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether passengers survived the disaster based on various features such as passenger class, sex, age, and family relationships. The goal is to achieve an accuracy score above 80% using KNN classification.

## 🎯 Success Metric

**Target Accuracy:** > 80%  
**Achieved Accuracy:** 80.0% (KNN Model)

## 📊 Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains the following features:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Survived` | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) - **Target Variable** |
| `Pclass` | Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) |
| `Sex` | Gender of passenger |
| `Age` | Age in years |
| `SibSp` | Number of siblings/spouses aboard |
| `Parch` | Number of parents/children aboard |
| `Ticket` | Ticket number |
| `Fare` | Passenger fare |
| `Cabin` | Cabin number |
| `Embarked` | Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |

## 🔧 Installation & Requirements

```bash
# Required libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

### Required Libraries:
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` - Numerical computing
- `matplotlib` - Data visualization
- `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning algorithms
- `scipy` - Scientific computing

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding
- Dataset contains 891 records with 12 features
- Mixed data types: integers, floats, and objects
- Initial data exploration and statistical summary

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Label Encoding:** Converted categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`) to numerical format
- **Missing Data Handling:**
  - `Age`: 177 missing values (imputed using class-based means)
  - `Cabin`: 687 missing values (column dropped)
  - `Embarked`: 2 missing values (rows dropped)
- **Feature Selection:** Removed non-predictive columns (`PassengerId`, `Name`, `Cabin`, `Fare`, `Ticket`)

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key findings from the analysis:
- **Gender Impact:** More females survived than males
- **Class Impact:** 3rd class passengers had lowest survival rates
- **Port of Embarkation:** Southampton had highest passenger count
- **Age Distribution:** Most passengers were between 15-35 years
- **Family Size:** Survival rates decreased with larger family sizes

### 4. Feature Engineering
- **Age Imputation Strategy:**
  - 1st Class: Mean age = 38 years
  - 2nd Class: Mean age = 28 years  
  - 3rd Class: Mean age = 25 years
- **Correlation Analysis:** No multicollinearity issues detected

### 5. Model Implementation

#### Baseline Model: Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy:** 71.91%
- Used as comparison benchmark

#### Primary Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Algorithm:** KNeighborsClassifier with k=5
- **Preprocessing:** StandardScaler for feature normalization
- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20 with stratification
- **Accuracy:** 80.0%
- **Confusion Matrix Results:**
  ```
  [[96 14]
   [22 46]]
  ```

#### Additional Model: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- **Accuracy:** 84.8%
- Combined with Random Forest Classifier
- Best performing model in the analysis

## 📈 Model Performance Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Logistic Regression | 71.91% | Baseline model |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors** | **80.0%** | **Primary model - meets success criteria** |
| LDA + Random Forest | 84.8% | Best performing model |

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Gender is the strongest predictor** - Females had significantly higher survival rates
2. **Passenger class matters** - 1st class passengers had better survival odds
3. **Age groups** - Younger passengers (15-35) were most common
4. **Family size impact** - Smaller families had better survival chances
5. **Port of embarkation** - Southampton passengers were most numerous

## 💻 Usage

```python
# Load and prepare data
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Load your dataset
titanic = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

# Follow the preprocessing steps in the notebook
# ... (data cleaning and feature engineering)

# Train the KNN model
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
classifier.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test_scaled)
```
